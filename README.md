# The see for the Address Book project

This project is an application skeleton for your address book Web app.  It uses the Bower package manager to handle front-end
dependencies, Node's package manager to handle back-end dependencies, with AngularJS/NodeJS handling app logic.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.
It also illustrates writing angular partials/views with the Jade templating library.

_Note: Although Jade supports interpolation, you should be doing that mostly on the client. Mixing
server and browser templating will complicate your app. Instead, use Jade as a syntactic sugar for
HTML, and let AngularJS take care of interpolation on the browser side._

## How to use address-book-seed

- Create an empty repository at GitHub (maybe address-book)
- Open up your terminal
- Run the following commands

```
cd /tmp # make sure this is a directory that exists
git clone --bare git@github.com:DojoDevCamp/address-book-seed.git
cd address-book-seed.git
git push --mirror git@github.com:[GitHubUsername]/address-book.git # this will be different for you
cd ..
rm -rf address-book-seed.git
```

### Running the app during development

* Make sure that NodeJS is installed
* From the CLI, in the project directory, run `npm install`

You can run the NodeJS server in two ways:

* Run `server/server.js` from the CLI
* Inside PyCharm, set up a NodeJS configuration

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/` to see the app running in
your browser.

### Running the app in production (Heroku)

* Create a Heroku account
* Create a MongoLab account
** In the server/server.js, replace <dbuser> and <dbpassword> with the MongoLab username and password, respectively
* Create a Heroku app from the CLI (under the project directory)
** heroku create [NAME]
* git push heroku master
